    "Here is information about survival analysis using Python in Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`):\n",
    "\n",
    "What is Survival Analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "Survival analysis is a statistical method used to analyze the expected duration of time until a specific event occurs. This event could be anything from a patient's death to the failure of a mechanical system, or even customer churn. It's also known as time-to-event analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Survival Function:** The probability of an individual or system surviving beyond a specific time.\n",
    "-   **Hazard Function:** The instantaneous risk of an event occurring at a specific time, given that the individual or system has survived up to that point.\n",
    "-   **Censoring:** When the event of interest is not observed for all individuals in the study (e.g., a patient is still alive at the end of the study).\n",
    "-   **Kaplan-Meier Estimator:** A non-parametric method to estimate the survival function.\n",
    "-   **Log-Rank Test:** A statistical test to compare the survival curves of two or more groups.\n",
    "-   **Cox Proportional Hazards Model:** A regression model that examines the relationship between predictors and the time-to-event through the hazard function. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python Libraries for Survival Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **lifelines:**\n",
    "    A popular library providing various survival analysis models, including Kaplan-Meier, Cox Proportional Hazards, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **scikit-survival:**\n",
    "    Built on top of scikit-learn, this library integrates survival analysis with machine learning workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **PyMC:**\n",
    "    A library for Bayesian statistical modeling, which can be used for Bayesian survival analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic Steps in a Jupyter Notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Import Libraries:** Import necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, lifelines, or scikit-survival.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Load and Prepare Data:**\n",
    "    Load your data into a pandas DataFrame. Ensure you have columns for:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Time to event (duration)\n",
    "    -   Event indicator (1 for event, 0 for censored)\n",
    "    -   Covariates (if using regression models)\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Kaplan-Meier Analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Create a `KaplanMeierFitter` object.\n",
    "    -   Fit the model to your data.\n",
    "    -   Plot the survival curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    kmf = KaplanMeierFitter()\n",
    "    kmf.fit(durations=df['time'], event_observed=df['event'])\n",
    "    kmf.plot_survival_function()\n",
    "    plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Cox Proportional Hazards Analysis:**\n",
    "    -   Create a `CoxPHFitter` object.\n",
    "    -   Fit the model to your data including covariates.\n",
    "    -   Inspect model results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    cph = CoxPHFitter()\n",

    "    cph.print_summary()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Log-Rank Test:**\n",
    "    -   Use the `logrank_test` function from `lifelines.statistics` to compare survival curves for different groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "from lifelines.statistics import logrank_test\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Jupyter Notebook allows for interactive data exploration and visualization.\n",
    "-   You can use magic commands like `%matplotlib inline` for displaying plots directly within the notebook.\n",
    "-   You can install libraries using `!pip install library_name` within a notebook cell.\n",
    "-   Survival analysis is used in various fields, including medicine, marketing, and engineering."
