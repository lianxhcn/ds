Model, predict and solve[¶](https://www.kaggle.com/code/startupsci/titanic-data-science-solutions#Model,-predict-and-solve)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now we are ready to train a model and predict the required solution. There are 60+ predictive modelling algorithms to choose from. We must understand the type of problem and solution requirement to narrow down to a select few models which we can evaluate. Our problem is a classification and regression problem. We want to identify relationship between output (Survived or not) with other variables or features (Gender, Age, Port...). We are also perfoming a category of machine learning which is called supervised learning as we are training our model with a given dataset. With these two criteria - Supervised Learning plus Classification and Regression, we can narrow down our choice of models to a few. These include:

-   Logistic Regression
-   KNN or k-Nearest Neighbors
-   Support Vector Machines
-   Naive Bayes classifier
-   Decision Tree
-   Random Forrest
-   Perceptron
-   Artificial neural network
-   RVM or Relevance Vector Machine
