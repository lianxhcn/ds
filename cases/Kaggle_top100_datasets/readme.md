**Dataset Description**

During my research on creating datasets for Kaggle, I realized there was no comprehensive dataset featuring the most upvoted datasets.

This project compiles and analyzes the top 100 datasets based on user votes, aiming to provide insights into dataset popularity and usability on Kaggle.

-   Dataset\_Name: Name of the dataset
-   Author: Creator or organization responsible for dataset
-   Last\_Update: Most recent date dataset was updated
-   Usability: Score indicating how easy dataset is to use
-   File\_Count: Number of files included in the dataset
-   Data\_Type: Types or formats of the data files
-   Size: Total size of dataset files (e.g., MB, GB)
-   Upvote: Number of user upvotes or endorsements
-   Rank: Popularity position among compared datasets

It is based on BeautifulSoup using Python.
